probability of selecting wrong choice from four choices for a single question , their by question become wrong is 3/4 which is 
p , so q which 1-p becomes 1/4 .

number of trails(number of questions) n = 20

r = 5  (exact number of errors expected)

p = 3/4 (probability of getting chossing error option from four option for a single question)

q = 1/4

p(x) = (n!/(x!(n-x)!)) p pow x (1-p) pow (n-x)  =  0.0000034265
